It contains my favorite topics gifs

This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page

that which is populated by gifs of my choice.

When the user clicks on a button the page should grab 10 static gif

images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page. when the image is 

click the image should animate and if the image is click agin the the image

should stop. Under every gif you can find the rating. Additionally, the app let

the user input the name of a topic and add an additonal button to the page.
